# ⚡ QUICK SETUP - Node.js Required

## 📥 Install Node.js (One-Time Setup)

**Why?** Node.js comes with npm, allowing you to run the backend server and install dependencies.

### Windows Installation:
1. Visit: https://nodejs.org (Download LTS version)
2. Run the installer
3. Click "Next" through all prompts
4. Accept the license agreement
5. Choose default installation path
6. Complete installation
7. **Restart your computer** (important!)
8. Open PowerShell and verify:
   ```powershell
   node --version
   npm --version
   ```

## 🚀 Start ShopHub (After Node.js Installation)

```powershell
# Open PowerShell in the ecommerce folder

# Install dependencies (one time)
npm install

# Start the server
npm start

# You should see:
# ✅ Server running at http://localhost:3000
```

Then open browser: **http://localhost:3000**

## Alternative: Use Live Server Extension (No Installation)

If you don't want to install Node.js:

1. Install "Live Server" extension in VS Code
2. Right-click `index.html` → "Open with Live Server"
3. Done! Site opens in browser

That's it! Your ecommerce site is now ready for backend integration. 🎉
